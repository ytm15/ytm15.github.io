# YouTube Mobile 2015/YTm15
A frontend/web-client for YouTube mobile based off the 2015 YT app for Android

## Want a desktop version instead?
Please check out <a href="https://vorapis.pages.dev/#/">Vorapis 2013/V3</a>, another project made by another person in the Old YouTube community, which also aims to restore YouTube's old UI, you can configure/stylize it to make it look like the 2015 YouTube UI. <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/customtube-restore-the-ol/iedffooliepgabiihipcbokboecnfcbe">CustomTube</a> also exists, however it's discontined/no-longer maintained

## To-do list
- Add one or more expflags for newer watch UIs
- Make the newer UIs more accurate and complete
- (possibly / tentative) Change this whole project's name (it isn't just the 2015 YT UI anymore so it's about time)

### More stuff will be added here later
